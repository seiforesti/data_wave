cursor/complete-advanced-catalog-frontend-implementation-9ca5
previously i asked for this request:{"look we have been working on a advanced strong powerful and modern data-governance system that are we looking to surpass relevant databricks and m.purview plateformes, so we have planned for the 6 interconnected choesive groups'data-sources,compliance,classifications , Advanced-Scan-Rule-Sets, Advanced-Catalog and Advanced-Scan-Logic,  those groups are thogethers combined represent all the data governance system, so we have started implimenting a real advanced backend logic for real production usig real modern logic implimentations withoit using any mock data(0%) , so we have completed the backend implimentation for the six groups it was a complex implimentations 'backend is under backend/scripts-automations/app/models/, services/, api/routes/**', and after that we have implimented the frontend parts entreprise core high level advanced implimentation architecture with detailed and advanced UIs design using shadn/ui and powerful tools for the 4 first groups ''data-sources,compliance,classifications,Advanced-Scan-Rule-Sets " under "v15_enhanced_1/components", so we have now rest two groups wich are the 'Advanced-Catalog and Advanced-Scan-Logic', so we have planned a advanced detailed plan for the three groups, that each one has its advanced entreprise core architecture detailed plan , so we have decided to start with the implimentation for the second group plan for 'v15_enhanced_1/components/Advanced-Catalog/' so, in the mentionned plan "@ADVANCED_ENTERPRISE_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md " u will find exactly all the plans needed for the rest of project, but now were focusing on the second plan wich is "v15_enhanced_1/components/Advanced-Catalog/", so u will focus correctly on the second plan for the "v15_enhanced_1/componentsAdvanced-Catalog/" and u can have all backend guidance for the "componentsAdvanced-Catalog" in the "@CORRECTED_BACKEND_MAPPING_CATALOG.md ", so now the work is start analyze deeply with high level resoning logic  all the backend assigned to the Advanced-Catalog under "@CORRECTED_BACKEND_MAPPING_CATALOG.md" , then i want u bazed exactly on the  guidance backend of advanced catalog group, adap and manipulate and turn the plan of  v15_enhanced_1/components/Advanced-Catalog/    in the @ADVANCED_ENTERPRISE_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md correctly adpated and responded exactly to all the backend implimmentation mentionned in "@CORRECTED_BACKEND_MAPPING_CATALOG.md "  thats mean that the plan "v15_enhanced_1/components/Advanced-Catalog/" right now not exactly correspond to the backend implimentation for the advanced catalog so bazed on the ""@CORRECTED_BACKEND_MAPPING_CATALOG.md "" i want u to adjust maniplate for robuts more percisely and more correctly the plan target for the advanced-catalog to be 100% ready and adapted to the backend advanced-catalog implimentation, after adjusting and adpting the plan i want u with advancely and hogh level core entreprise with focusing mapped all backend implimentation to the plan correctly, wich mean u will map exactly all backend implimentation planned in '"@CORRECTED_BACKEND_MAPPING_CATALOG.md "' to the new adapted plan, then with advanced high level reasonning and advanced logic workflow start generating and building all target files in the plan with high accuracy and attention without missing any single file of the backend catalog, so start building all the types needed, hooks, constants, services, and utils, all complete without missing or incorrected mapping to ensure that 100% frontend components /advanced-catalog mapped on 100% backend implimentation for advanced catalog, there is also shared services and files we need to use to ensure that the advanced catalog is highly advanced and modern to surpass the relevant platefoprme loke databricks and m.purview, so be aware because the advanced catalog group is a advanced production level needs to be highly implimented, so we have started implimented some of 'types, constants, and services' so i need you now to check again the "CORRECTED_BACKEND_MAPPING_CATALOG.md" for all backend still not mapped to the plan /Advanced-catalog plan and, an then check what missed types, constants, services, hooks, and utils then mapped to those files in the frontend /Adanced-catalog plan and complete all those files, look i want u to complete all the frontend " types, constants, services, hooks, and utils" and confirm that all completed and mapped to 100% backend implimentation /Advanced-catalog that mentionned " "CORRECTED_BACKEND_MAPPING_CATALOG.md""} , so the system has planned perfectly a types, services, hooks, constants, and utils, and generate a new .md file that resume what exactly finished"ADVANCED_CATALOG_FRONTEND_COMPLETION_VERIFICATION.md
", so i want u now to check all the existing implimentation and check again if there are missed implimentation still not implimented and mapped to the frontend /Advanced-catalog bazed on all backend catalog implimentation in'ADVANCED_CATALOG_FRONTEND_COMPLETION_VERIFICATION.md
' then complete all implientations, and then if any of the all  implimentations  under components/Advanced-Catalog still not exist or not supported by the backend i want u to impliment it in the backend and let it interconnected to the backend-catalog implimentation backend to ensure that is fully interconnected


now i want u to check the plan"ADVANCED_ENTERPRISE_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md" for the /Advanced-Catalog and complete all remains components group by group  , with advanced and powerful level implimentation for a modern advanced system, complete all components group by group, all bazed on the backend implimentations in the /types, /hooks, /services, /constants and /utils, each component must exploit all the backend needed for its use wich mean every single component must be developed itha advanced level detailed ui design sing shadn/ui with advanced tools, and must exploite all backend needs for its serving ponints, to surpass databricks and m.purview, generate each component wich modern advanced logic workflow actions
