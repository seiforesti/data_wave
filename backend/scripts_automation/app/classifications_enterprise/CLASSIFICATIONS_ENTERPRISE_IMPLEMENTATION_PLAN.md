# ðŸš€ Classifications Enterprise Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for building an advanced, enterprise-grade, multi-version classification system for data governance, surpassing Databricks and Microsoft Purview.

## Implementation Order
1. Scan-Rule-Sets (complete enterprise integration)
2. Data Catalog (enhance and integrate)
3. Scan Logic (enhance and integrate)
4. Classifications (enterprise core, this plan)

## Classifications System: Three Versions

### Version 1: Manual & Rule-Based
- Manual classification (regex, dictionary, bulk upload)
- Sensitivity labeling (PII, PHI, Confidential, etc.)
- Full audit trail

### Version 2: ML-Driven
- ML models for auto-classification
- User feedback loop
- Advanced sensitivity labeling

### Version 3: AI-Intelligent
- AI-powered, context-aware classification
- Intelligent assistant for suggestions, comments, tags
- Auto-generated insights and optimization

## Architecture
- Modular, versioned, and fully auditable
- Deep integration with data sources, scan, catalog, and compliance
- Real-time, explainable, and user-friendly

## Next Steps
- Design models and services
- Build API routes
- Integrate with other groups
- Develop frontend enhancements

## Folder Structure
- models/
- services/
- api/routes/
- ml/
- utils/
- tests/

## Timeline
- Version 1: 3-4 days
- Version 2: 4-5 days
- Version 3: 5-7 days
