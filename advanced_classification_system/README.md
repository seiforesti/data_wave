# Advanced Classification System

This folder contains the next-generation, enterprise-grade classification and sensitivity labeling system. It is designed to:

- Surpass Databricks and Microsoft Purview in intelligence, automation, and productivity
- Provide advanced ML/AI-driven classification, sensitivity labeling, and governance
- Integrate deeply with data catalog, schema, access control, audit, and analytics
- Support user productivity with context-aware search, auto-generated insights, and AI-powered comments/tags
- Enable robust compliance, audit, and policy enforcement

## Implementation Plan
See [../ADVANCED_CLASSIFICATION_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](../ADVANCED_CLASSIFICATION_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for the full architecture, feature matrix, and roadmap.

## Integration
This system is designed to connect with existing backend and frontend services, including:
- Sensitivity labeling APIs and models
- ML/Hybrid classifiers and feedback loops
- Data catalog and schema discovery
- Analytics, audit, and notification services
- Modern React/Next.js frontend for user interaction

## Getting Started
Implementation will proceed in phases, starting with modularizing hybrid/ML classification and progressing to fully intelligent, AI-powered automation and insights.
