# Advanced Enterprise Classification System Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the architecture, features, and phased implementation plan for a next-generation, enterprise-grade classification and sensitivity labeling system. The system is designed to surpass Databricks and Microsoft Purview in intelligence, automation, and productivity, and is fully integrated with data governance and compliance workflows.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview
- **Backend**: Modular FastAPI services, extensible ML/AI pipeline, robust RBAC, and audit.
- **ML/AI**: Hybrid, ML-only, and next-gen intelligent models with feedback and explainability.
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js UI, context-aware search, insights, and productivity boosters.
- **Integration**: Deep hooks into catalog, schema, access control, notifications, and analytics.

## 4. Service, Model, and Route Analysis
- **Sensitivity Labeling**: `/sensitivity-labels/` endpoints (proposals, suggestions, analytics, ML feedback, bulk ops)
- **ML/Hybrid Classifiers**: `app/api/classifiers/` (regex, dictionary, hybrid, ML models)
- **Schema/Catalog**: `catalog_tree/`, `DataTableSchema` model for schema-aware logic
- **Analytics**: `/sensitivity-labels/analytics/` endpoints for coverage, trends, anomalies
- **Frontend**: Hooks in `src/api/` for labels, ML, insights, advanced search
- **Governance**: RBAC, audit, notification, and access control integration

---

## 5. Advanced ML/AI Design
- **V1**: Hybrid (regex + dictionary + ML), user upload, manual review
- **V2**: ML-only, feedback loop, retraining, explainability, bulk ops
- **V3**: Intelligent AI (LLM/transformer-based), context-aware, auto-insights, domain-specific logic, AI-powered comments/tags, self-optimizing
- **Feedback**: User feedback, audit, and retraining endpoints
- **Explainability**: Model explainers, feature importance, user-facing rationales

---

## 6. User Productivity & Experience
- **Context-Aware Search**: Advanced search endpoints, UI hooks
- **Auto-Generated Insights**: ML-driven insights, recommendations, productivity boosters
- **AI-Powered Comments/Tags**: LLM-generated comments, tags, and rationales for classifications
- **Bulk Operations**: Import/export, batch review, mass classification
- **UI/UX**: Modern, responsive, and intuitive interfaces for all user roles

---

## 7. Governance & Compliance Integration
- **Access Control**: Label-driven access, RBAC, row-level security
- **Audit Trail**: Full logging of proposals, reviews, feedback, and ML actions
- **Notifications**: Expiry, review, approval/rejection, and system alerts
- **Policy Enforcement**: Integration with data access and compliance layers

---

## 8. Deployment, Performance, and TCO
- **Scalability**: Modular services, async processing, background jobs
- **Performance**: ML model optimization, caching, batch processing
- **TCO**: Automated retraining, self-healing, cloud-native deployment
- **Monitoring**: Analytics endpoints, dashboard integration

---

## 9. Roadmap & Milestones
1. **Phase 1**: Modularize existing hybrid/ML classification, enable file upload, collaborative workflow (V1)
2. **Phase 2**: Automate ML-only classification, feedback loop, explainability, advanced analytics (V2)
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate intelligent AI, auto-insights, AI-powered comments/tags, domain intelligence, TCO optimization (V3)
4. **Phase 4**: Deep integration with governance, access control, and compliance
5. **Phase 5**: Continuous improvement, user feedback, and performance tuning

---

## 10. Integration Points & Next Steps
- Reference and extend existing models/services (see `backend/scripts_automation/sensitivity_labeling/`, `app/api/classifiers/`, `catalog_tree/`, `src/api/`)
- Ensure all new features are API-driven and UI-integrated
- Collaborate with data governance and compliance teams for policy alignment
- Begin with V1 implementation in a new `advanced_classification_system/` folder, with clear separation and documentation
