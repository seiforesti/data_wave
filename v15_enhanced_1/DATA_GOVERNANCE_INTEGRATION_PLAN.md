## Technical Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// Main data governance orchestrator
case "data-sources":
  return <EnterpriseDataSourcesApp />

case "scan":
  return <ScanSystemApp />

case "scan-rules":
  return <ScanRuleSetApp />

case "compliance":
  return <ComplianceRuleApp />
```

### Backend Integration
```python
# Backend services structure
/backend/scripts_automation/
├── app/
│   ├── api/           # API endpoints
│   ├── models/        # Data models
│   ├── services/      # Business logic
│   └── core/          # Core infrastructure
├── sensitivity_labeling/  # Data classification
└── tests/            # Test suite
```

### Data Flow
1. **Frontend** → **API Gateway** → **Backend Services**
2. **Event Bus** → **Real-time Updates** → **Frontend**
3. **Workflow Engine** → **Process Automation** → **All Systems**

## Conclusion

The data sources group is now complete with enterprise-level features. The three-phase system provides a clear roadmap for data source management maturity. The next step is to systematically implement the remaining groups, starting with the most critical ones for enterprise data governance.

The integration architecture is solid and ready to accommodate new groups. Each group should follow the same pattern:
1. Create standalone SPA component
2. Add enterprise features
3. Integrate with main orchestrator
4. Add real-time updates
5. Implement advanced analytics

This approach ensures consistency across all groups while maintaining the flexibility to add enterprise-specific features as needed.
